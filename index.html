    <h3 class="pad">The Magic of Festival Season</h3>
    <p>Music festivals happen all over the world. To be brief, music festivals are usually large gatherings of people to celebrate life, music and the arts. They are usually 2-5 days long and are on some kind of camping venue. Festivals are a great way to meet new people from all over the world as people travel great lengths to attend these events. </p>

    <h3>What to Bring</h3>
    <p class="gear">When packing for a music festival, you must be sure to be prepared for the worst. There's nothing worse than being underprepared. Usually, I bring basic camping supplies such as a tent, sleeping bag, rain boots, rain gear etc. If you plan like you are camping in the woods, you will be ready for whatever the summer elements throw at you.</p>
    <h3>Work Your Way Up</h3>
    <p>A lot of people want to immediately go to the larger festivals with 60,000+ people. Ths can be a good time, but it is not recommended. It can be overwhelming in many situations. Lines for everything will be longer, most items will be more expensive and the crowd tends to be a great deal less-desirable. Once you become acustomed to the festival vibe, it is then a good idea to work your way up to the larger more intense festivals.</p>
